The aim of the game is to collect 300 points.

1 point is earned for each bait collected.

When the green round bait is collected, the randomly moving ghosts become frightened and you gain 10 points.

If you collect the frightened ghosts, the ghosts will return to the starting position and you will gain 100 points.
